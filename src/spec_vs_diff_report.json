REQ-13 is not evidenced because no static image assets were added in the diff summary. REQ-14 is only partially met because the Footer still contains text branding (“© {year} SolviroStudio”).",

      "requirement": "Add the original uploaded logo to frontend static assets and include at least two optimized variants under frontend/public/assets/generated (header/nav and square favicon/app icon), with transparent background where applicable and crisp rendering.",
      "reason": "The diff references /assets/generated/... PNGs in code, but the diff summary does not show any added image files under frontend/public/assets/generated (or any documented assets folder) or any evidence that the original uploaded file was added.",
